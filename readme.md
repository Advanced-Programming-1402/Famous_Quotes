## Intro
Welcome to your first practice on git and github!
- as you learned, fork this repo
- clone it, so you have it on your machine
- add a branch with your name, for example: `shayan_shahrabi` or `gholi_gholizadeh`
- add a `.txt` file to the repo with the name of the quoter as the name of the file and the quote as the text within the file
- push the file
- send a pull request

Wish you all the best!
